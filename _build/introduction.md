One important aspect to embrace Open Science is to base your scientific process on cooperative work and use many different ways 
for diffusing knowledge to be as inclusive as possible.  
Achieving openness requires an open approach at all stages of the research process and requires you to identify the key actors 
i.e. your target audience. As this may evolve, it is important to choose tools that can facilitate the diffusion of your research results.  

That is exactly what we are addressing in this workshop.

Ideally, Open Science is simply Science.
